The distance to spot ratio is 12:1, which means you can measure the target at a longer distance. For the best accuracy, the thermometer should be 14 in\/ 36 cm away from the object.\n\u25ba\u3010MORE APPLICABLE FUNCTIONS\u3011 This infrared thermometer accurately test the temperature during -58\u2109\uff5e1112\u2109(-50\u2103\uff5e600\u2103); Toggle between Celsius\/Fahrenheit measurements as needed; has a LCD backlight so you can view the temperatures even in the dark; Auto power off function saves power.\n\u25ba\u3010SCOPE OF APPLICATION:\u3011 Infrared technology makes the thermometer can be used to measure temperature in dail","file_title":"Infrared Thermometer (Not for Human) Non-Contact Digital Laser Temperature Gun Pyrometer with LCD Co","file_duration":"13.04","file_width":"426","file_height":"240","file_tags":"aaa,ddd","etag":null,"file_name":"04b6ce7f-0baa-4adc-823f-ea6497901719","mime":"video\/mp4","file_size":662515,"created_at":"2023-11-17 15:24:23","updated_at":"2023-11-17 15:32:28","owner_id":8,"user_id":8,"email":"demo@demo.com","user_updated_at":"2023-11-17 15:29:04","avatar":"https:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/53444f91e698c0c7caa2dbc3bdbf93fc?s=&d=retro","available_space":10737418240,"channel":"Sovarcate","channel_description":"desc here","trusted":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"instagram":null,"web":null,"banned_at":null},"token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.WyIwNGI2Y2U3Zi0wYmFhLTRhZGMtODIzZi1lYTY0OTc5MDE3MTkiXQ.8B9FSJN-nygfIlF4NWaplGQB1ITChEfgndas2TOsAXM","event":"create"}
